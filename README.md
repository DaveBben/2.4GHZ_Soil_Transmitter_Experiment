# NRF 2.4GHZ Soil Transmitter Experiment
This was an early experiment for my [Wireless Soil Moisture Sensors project](https://github.com/DaveBben/Soil_Moisture_Transmitter_Reciver). I ended up using 433mhz radio in the final product but this was a test using 2.4GHZ radio with the RadioHead library.

The receiver.cpp is intended to be ran on the raspberry pi.
